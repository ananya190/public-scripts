log sorting
-----------

this script is used to sort the captain's log, because it
will receive input from a number of different sources - the
watch, etc.

it utilizes a file called history.txt that stores a single
line of text - the date of the last file that was sorted. 

a number of options are presented to the user:
- default: sort all files from the last one sorted to
  today's (if it exists)
- specific: sort one file
- range: sort files between a range
